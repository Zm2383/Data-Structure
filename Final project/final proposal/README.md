## Final Project Proposal

#### wi_zm2383

A Python package for getting weather information

#### Type of project: 

API Client (A) 

#### Brief description of the purpose

Query the weather information and wind information of the input city or region.

To deal with this problem, this package will comprise several functionalities:

- allow users to get basic weather information
- allow users to get the wind information
- provide the wind chart



        
      
#### Links to data sources / API etc

For this assignment, I will be using openweathermap. I can collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.
This is the link to the API documentation: https://openweathermap.org/api
This is the base URL of the API:https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
  
#### Outline the technical steps / challenges you plan to address and include in your submission

* Query API to obtain data from API
* Handle, parse, and transform JSON return into a dataframe 
* Create a mapping function that links weather information 
* Use Regex to search patterns in variables, allowing users to look up available variables in dataset
* Provide information on weather, and visualize the results
* Wrap up everything in a Python package
